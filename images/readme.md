# Oldagram project

- did this project to practice my CSS skills
  

### Room for improvement - add JS functionality
- increase likes, when clicking on heart or double clicking on image
- loop through provided array to display all three images
- when hover/active like,comment, dm icons - make them grey(use opacity?)
